# Sales Summary Application

## 1. Summary/Overview of the Application

This is a single-page web application that fetches sales data from a CSV file encoded in base64, calculates the total sales, and displays the result. The application sets a specific document title and uses Bootstrap 5 for styling.

## 2. Setup Instructions

1. Save all files (`index.html`, `script.js`, and this `README.md`) in the same directory.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to run the application.
3. No server is required as the application runs entirely client-side.

## 3. Usage Guide with Examples

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. The application will:
1. Automatically fetch the embedded CSV data
2. Calculate the sum of the sales column
3. Display the total sales amount in the card on the page
4. Set the document title as specified in the requirements

The application should show a total sales value of 586.45.

## 4. Code Explanation and Architecture

- `index.html`: Contains the basic HTML structure with Bootstrap 5 styling. Includes the script.js file.
- `script.js`: Fetches the base64 encoded CSV data, parses it, calculates the sum of sales, and updates the DOM with the result.

The application follows a simple architecture:
1. Data fetching (client-side fetch of base64 CSV)
2. Data processing (parsing and summing)
3. UI update (displaying the result)
